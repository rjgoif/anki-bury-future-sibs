## This add-on will bury all NEW siblings of cards that are due on or before today.
## This way you can get started on your new cards right away when you start your
## daily studies without worrying about them causing overdue cascades: the only
## new cards in your queue will be those that are "daily orphans" (you won't be
## studying their siblings today).

## this only makes sense to do if you have either have your new cards mixed in
## or have them ahead of your reviews. Thus, this add-on will override (WITHOUT
## CHANGING) your deck's settings for when new cards come up. It's important that
## if you normally have new cards last, you leave the actual Anki settings to 
## reflect this. Why? So if you start your daily studying online or iOS, it does
## not totally screw up your burying scheme.


## recommended add-on to use with this one: my "push siblings back" feature.
## (they were made to work together)

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

## version 20
## this is legacy for Anki 2.0. No longer supported. Also there code isn't tidy, sorry.
